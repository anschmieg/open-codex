# Merge Analysis: OpenAI Codex Integration

## Overview
Successfully merged 385 commits from `openai/codex` into `anschmieg/open-codex` fork on 2025-01-27.

## What Was Merged
- **385 commits** from the original `openai/codex` repository
- Over **200+ new features and improvements** from upstream
- Major additions including:
  - Complete **Rust implementation** (`codex-rs/` directory)
  - **MCP (Model Context Protocol) support**
  - **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
  - Enhanced **sandboxing and security features**
  - New **CLI commands and features**
  - Updated **dependencies and tooling**

## Fork-Specific Changes Preserved ✅
- ✅ Package name remains `open-codex`
- ✅ Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- ✅ Chat Completions API instead of Responses API
- ✅ Custom installation instructions in TypeScript implementation

## Rust Implementation Status ⚠️

### Current State
The **Rust implementation is the original OpenAI source code** and does **NOT** contain fork customizations.

### Evidence
1. **Package references:** Still uses `@openai/codex@native` (should be `open-codex`)
2. **Repository URLs:** Points to `https://github.com/openai/codex/releases`
3. **Documentation:** All references are to OpenAI's original project
4. **Code structure:** Chat completions implementation is OpenAI's original code
5. **No multi-provider support** visible in Rust codebase

### Files Examined
- `codex-rs/Cargo.toml` - Original OpenAI workspace configuration
- `codex-rs/README.md` - Contains OpenAI branding and package references
- `codex-rs/core/src/chat_completions.rs` - Original OpenAI chat completions implementation

## Required Work for Rust Implementation

### Phase 1: Branding and Package Updates
- [ ] Change `@openai/codex@native` to `open-codex@native` in documentation
- [ ] Update GitHub repository URLs to point to `anschmieg/open-codex`
- [ ] Update `codex-rs/README.md` to reflect fork-specific features
- [ ] Change installation instructions to use `open-codex`
- [ ] Update any hardcoded references to OpenAI

### Phase 2: Multi-Provider Support
- [ ] Extend Rust chat completions implementation to support multiple providers
- [ ] Port TypeScript multi-provider logic to Rust
- [ ] Add configuration for OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.
- [ ] Ensure Rust config system supports fork's provider configurations
- [ ] Port custom config options from TypeScript version

### Phase 3: Feature Parity
- [ ] Review TypeScript implementation for other fork-specific features
- [ ] Port remaining customizations to Rust
- [ ] Ensure both implementations maintain feature parity

## Current Status
- **TypeScript Implementation:** ✅ Fully updated with fork customizations preserved
- **Rust Implementation:** ⚠️ Original OpenAI code, needs customization work
- **Repository:** ✅ Successfully merged and pushed to `anschmieg/open-codex`

## Next Steps
1. **Build and test** current TypeScript implementation
2. **Verify** all existing functionality works correctly
3. **Plan** Rust implementation customization strategy
4. **Consider** whether to maintain both implementations or focus on one

## Merge Statistics
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Commits ahead:** 385 commits from original fork point
- **Conflicts resolved:** 54 files successfully merged
- **Strategy used:** `-X theirs` with manual conflict resolution for fork-specific files
